In this tutorial, we will look at traffic accidents in Edinburgh.
The data are made available [online](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data/datafile/36f1658e-b709-47e7-9f56-cca7aefeb8fe/preview) by the UK Government. 
It covers all recorded accidents in Edinburgh in 2018 and some of the variables were modified for the purposes of this tutorial. 

### Learning goals

- Continue practising data visualization skills with ggplot2. 
- Filter data for certain attributes with `filter()`. 
- Create new variables based on existing variables in the data with `mutate()`. 

### Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for the analysis and the **dsbox** package for the data.
These packages are already installed for you, so you load it as usual by running the following code:

```{r load-packages, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r load-packages-solution}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r load-packages-check}
grade_this_code("The tidyverse and dsbox packages are now loaded!")
```

## Data

The data is in the `dsbox` package and it's called `accidents`. 

Below is an excerpt of the data dictionary. 
Note that it is long (there are lots of variables in the data), but we will be using a limited set of the variables for our analysis.

| Header                        |  Description

| `urban_rural` | Type of area the accident occurred in
| `police` | Did police officer attend the scene of the accident: No, No + accident self reported (using a self completion form), Yes

### First look at the data

You can take a peek at the data using the `glimpse()` function in the box below.

```{r glimpse-data, exercise = TRUE}
glimpse(diamonds)
```

```{r quiz-rows}
question("What does each row in the dataset represent?",
    answer("The registration number of a car"),
    answer("The location of an accident"),
    answer("A recorded accident",
           correct = TRUE,
           message = "Each row in the dataset contains all information relating to an individual recorded accident in Edinburgh."),
    answer("An insurance claim "),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```

How many accidents were recorded in Edinburgh in 2018? 
Use the following code chunk to submit your answer. 

```{r nrow, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nrow-hint-1}
Each row represents one recorded accident!
```

```{r nrow-hint-2}
Try using nrow()!
```

## Wrap up

You have finished tutorial two, good job! 
We hope you enjoyed this lesson on data visualisation.
